Worksheets are guided exercises that are meant to supplement lectures, and will be graded as part of your final mark in STAT545.

Worksheets are produced with Jupyter Notebooks. For installation instructions, see [Lecture 1A (Installation)](lectures_i/lec1a_installation.qmd) or check out [this YouTube video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jPaI1njy3E)

[Worksheets will be posted on the dates given on the table!]{.underline}

[**Worksheet Tips and Tricks:**]{.underline}

-   Download the .ipynb file from GitHub and save it on your personal computer.

-   Only edit cells where prompted. If you accidentally click on a text-only cell, hit the play button and it should re-render.

-   You can check your answers prior to submitting! If you see a "Success!" message, you got the question right. Otherwise, a detailed error message will help you diagnose what went wrong.

-   Save your work frequently.

-   Prior to submitting, restart your kernel and run all to ensure that no errors persist. Save again.

-   Submit the .ipynb file to Canvas with the file name "worksheet_a##".

-   We're here to help along the way on Slack, so don't be shy to ask for help if you need it.
