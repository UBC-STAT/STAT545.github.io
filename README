Instructions for Updating Website

Website is built using Quarto, and is hosted on GitHub pages through the UBC-STAT Organization.

I (Grace) rebuilt this website in 2025 to use Quarto and provide a more easily editable and maintainable website for this course.

To edit the website:
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Open the R project
- Edit the webpages (.qmd files) in the webpages folder
- If adding any webpages, add them to the _quarto.yml file 

MDA and Collaborative project instructions are hidden until the page goes live? (Grace - update instructions once this is set up) 

Running the course:
- Post worksheets week by week (un-comment each download link)
- Post MDA and collaborative project when appropriate (see above)
- 


NOTES:
- index.qmd must be named index.qmd and must be on the top level (not in a folder)
