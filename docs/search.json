    "text": "Welcome to STAT 545 at the University of British Columbia! Whether you’re a student enrolled in STAT 545 or simply someone looking to learn how to write reproducible and collaborative data analyses, it is our hope that this website will serve as a great resource for learning these new skills!\nIn short, this course will enable you to confidently write clean and modern data analyses in R using version control software (GitHub), and creating reports using R Markdown. The primary focus will be on using these technologies to conduct analyses with daily workflow, rather than the statistical theory and methods for analysis.\nThis course is divided into two parts. In Part I (STAT545 A), we will introduce\n\nR and RStudio,\nReport generation with R Markdown,\nProject organization, workflow, and coding style,\nData management with dataframes and tibbles using tidyverse,\nData visualization with ggplot2, and\nVersion control using Git and Github.\n\nIn Part II (STAT545 B), we will dive deeper into\n\nWriting functions in R,\nAdvanced computations on data,\nFunctional programming with purrr,\nR packages,\nInteractive pages, apps, and graphics with RShiny, and\nWebsite development using Quarto.\n\nIf you are a student enrolling in this course for credit at UBC, you MUST take STAT 545 A to enroll in STAT545 B. There are no exceptions to this rule."

If required, regrade requests can be escalated to the instructor only if the request has already been brought up to the TA team and the student is unsatisfied. The instructor reserves the right to regrade the entire assessment, resulting in a higher or lower mark than originally provided.\n\n\nAuditing Students\nAuditing students are expected to complete all assessments (see above). All assessments are graded on a pass/fail basis for those officially auditing.\nYou must be registered as an auditing student to attend lectures due to capacity limitations.\n\n\nCourse Communications\nWe will be using Slack as our primary platform of all course-related communications! Students will be emailed an invite to their class’ Slack workspace.\nOfficial course communications will occur on the #announcements channel. You will receive an invite on the first day of classes. Please notify the instructor by email if you have not received your personal invite.\nOur STAT 545 team will be actively monitoring Slack during regular working hours (9am to 5pm PT, Monday to Friday). You are free to ask questions outside of this window but please keep in mind that there are no expectations for the team to answer questions outside of working hours or on weekends or holidays.\nTo make the most out of Slack, please\n\nUse the #general channel for clarifications, asking about course organization, or clarifying instructions. Things you post on the #general channel will be seen by everyone, so please do not provide information that gives away answers to assignments.\nMake a group chat with our TAs when you need more personalized help, or have an issue with grading. They may direct you to the #general channel when appropriate, or direct you to the instructor.\nDirect message the instructor if there is a concern that is more personal (i.e., you need to self declare an absense) or if you have already talked to the TAs about an issue and are unsatisfied. You can also direct message the instructor if you are having issues with a group member in any group-related assignments.\nPost in the #random channel if you find things related to the course that you’d like to share\n\n\n\nPrivacy\nSlack and GitHub are hosted on servers stored outside of Canada. Please keep this in mind.\n\n\nPolicies\n\nLate Policies\nWorksheets (and larger assignments, if applicable) are due at 11:59pm PT on the date indicated in the course schedule. For a late submission, a 24 hour extension will be provided for the first offense. Late submissions will be given a grade of 0 for subsequent occurrences.\nThere is a zero-tolerance policy for late projects, including the mini data analysis and the collaborative project. If you are having issues with a team member regarding any group work, reach out to the instructor directly through Slack or email.\n\n\nAcademic Concession\nUBC no longer requires a doctor’s note (or supporting documentation) for academic concession. A self-declaration will suffice – here is a template you can use. The form is also posted on our Canvas page. Please submit this to the instructor via email.\nExamples of “conflicting responsibility” are conference travel and time-sensitive field work.\nIf you arrange to have an assignment submitted late, you may not be able to receive feedback from your peers.\n\n\nPlagiarism\nPlagiarism, which is intellectual theft, occurs where an individual submits or presents the oral or written work of another person as his or her own and can include:\n\nmultiple students submitting the same response\ncopying from sources without citing them\ncopying verbatim (word-for-word) from source and citing, but failing to make it explicit that this is a quotation (quotations should be used only rarely, if at all)\n\nStudents are responsible for ensuring that any work submitted does not constitute plagiarism. Students who are in any doubt as to what constitutes plagiarism should consult their instructor before handing in any assignments.\nFor more information see the UBC Academic Misconduct policies.\n\n\nCode Plagiarism\nStudents must correctly cite any code that has been authored by someone else or by the student themselves for other assignments. Cases of code plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:\n\nthe reproduction (copying and pasting) of code with none or minimal reformatting (e.g., changing the name of the variables)\nthe translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to another\nthe generation of code by automatic code-generations software\n\nAn “adequate acknowledgement” requires a detailed identification of the (parts of the) code reused and a full citation of the original source code that has been reused.\n\n\nUBC’s Policies and Resources to Support Student Success\nUBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious, spiritual and cultural observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions. Details of the policies and how to access support are available here.\n\n\nYour personal health\nIf you’re sick, it’s important that you stay home – no matter what you think you may be sick with (e.g., cold, flu, other). Your precautions will help reduce risk and keep everyone safer. The structure of this class is intended to provide flexibility so that you can prioritize your health and still be able to succeed.\nIf you do miss class because of illness:\n\nConsult the class resources on the course website\nCome to office hours on Zoom.\nUse Slack to carry out discussions.\n\nIf you miss an assessment due to illness, see the above section on Academic Concessions, and review the UBC policy here: http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,329,0,0\n\n\nInstructor health\nIf I am ill, then I will not come to class. If that happens, here’s what you can expect:\n\nIf I am well enough to teach, I will conduct virtual lectures through Zoom until I am well. If this happens, you will be tagged in an announcement via Slack with information. You can anticipate that this would very likely be a last minute announcement. Our classroom will still be available for you to sit and attend an online session, although it is recommended that you bring headphones.\nIf I am not well enough to teach, it is possible that one or more teaching assistants will take my place. But if not, we will either try to make up for lost time, make new resources to aid in your learning, or make accommodations regarding the assessments.\n\n\n\n\nCopyright\nCourse materials are licensed under Creative Commons 4.0.",

    "text": "When is the course offered?\nSeptember - December of each academic year. Typical format: STAT 545A 1.5 credits in September through mid October, followed by STAT 545B 1.5 credits from mid October through early December.\n\n\nWhat happened to STAT 547M?\nSTAT 547M became STAT 545B in 2020, so that the course codes align. Otherwise, these are the same courses.\n\n\nWhat happened to the guidebook?\nWe used a guidebook in 2019/2020. It’s still available at https://stat545guidebook.netlify.app, but had become deprecated in place of worksheets and some tutorials.\n\n\nWhy are there two courses, instead of a single “STAT 545” course?\nFor several years, Jenny Bryan taught STAT 545A as a 1.5 credit course. She – and many students – felt there was a lot of great, relevant content that could go into an additional 1.5 credits.\nA full semester of data exploration, visualization, and all-around data wrangling was piloted in 2014/2015. It was structured as two half courses primarily so that several year’s worth of STAT 545A alums could register for the second part (then STAT 547M) and get the “missing half” of the course. And now it’s hard to break the cycle.\n\n\nI have taken STAT 545A for 1.5 credits in the past. Can I take STAT 545B?\nYes, but STAT 545 keeps evolving to keep current with the R world. It is your responsibility to fill in any gaps.\n\n\nCan I just take the second half, i.e. STAT 545B?\nNo, not unless you have taken STAT 545A previously.\n\n\nI am an undergraduate. Can I take this course?\nMaybe, if there’s room. Contact the instructor.\n\n\nWhat if I’ve never had a stats class?\nThere are no official pre-requisites for STAT 545A but most students will have had at least one prior statistics course or comparable experience.\n\n\nI’m not enrolled – can I sit in during class?\nUnfortunately not. The room is usually at capacity, and further, we’ve allocated TA time for the specific number of students attending the class. Feel free to follow along online using the online lecture resources.\n\n\nI’d like to officially audit – can I?\nAbsolutely! Please take a look at what is required of auditors in the Syllabus so that you have an understanding of your expectations coming into the course; then, fill out the form (graduate version) and send it to the instructor to get signed.\n\n\nThe course is full – can I audit instead?\nYou’ll still have to join the waitlist – auditing still counts as a seat in the class, so auditing is not a way around the course capacity.\nIn all cases, I encourage you to register! Or if the course is full, join the waitlist. Alternatively, you can engage in your own self-study using our online resources.\n\n\nThe course is full. Is there a chance that the course capacity will increase?\nUnfortunately, the course enrollment capacity will not increase. But, I encourage you to join the waitlist.\n\n\nThe course is listed as “restricted”. What should I do?\nWhen all the open seats are taken, the course is listed as “restricted”, as the remaining seats can only be taken by students of specific types. If you are a student of that type, then go ahead and register! Otherwise, I encourage you to join the waitlist.\n\n\nShould I take this course?\nThis course is open to any graduate student at UBC. Students from other departments vastly outnumber those from the Statistics Department. In fact, the most successful students are often grad students from other fields who need to analyze and visualize data for a thesis. They are highly motivated and excel.\nHowever, if you have never programmed or worked at the command line before, prepare for a shock. This will be a powerful, positive experience, but it’s a big adjustment. Come suffer through the worst part of the learning curve in good company!\n\n\nDo I need a computer?\nYes! You absolutely must have access to a computer on which you can install software, download data, etc. In fact, class meetings will be a mix of lecture, discussion, and live coding. Students will get the most out of this if they can bring their own laptop to class every day. If this is not possible, we will try to help you work something out."

Please submit this to the instructor via email.\nExamples of “conflicting responsibility” are conference travel and time-sensitive field work.\nIf you arrange to have an assignment submitted late, you may not be able to receive feedback from your peers.\n\n\nPlagiarism\nPlagiarism, which is intellectual theft, occurs where an individual submits or presents the oral or written work of another person as his or her own and can include:\n\nmultiple students submitting the same response\ncopying from sources without citing them\ncopying verbatim (word-for-word) from source and citing, but failing to make it explicit that this is a quotation (quotations should be used only rarely, if at all)\n\nStudents are responsible for ensuring that any work submitted does not constitute plagiarism. Students who are in any doubt as to what constitutes plagiarism should consult their instructor before handing in any assignments.\nFor more information see the UBC Academic Misconduct policies.\n\n\nCode Plagiarism\nStudents must correctly cite any code that has been authored by someone else or by the student themselves for other assignments. Cases of code plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:\n\nthe reproduction (copying and pasting) of code with none or minimal reformatting (e.g., changing the name of the variables)\nthe translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to another\nthe generation of code by automatic code-generations software\n\nAn “adequate acknowledgement” requires a detailed identification of the (parts of the) code reused and a full citation of the original source code that has been reused.\n\n\nUBC’s Policies and Resources to Support Student Success\nUBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious, spiritual and cultural observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions. Details of the policies and how to access support are available here.\n\n\nYour personal health\nIf you’re sick, it’s important that you stay home – no matter what you think you may be sick with (e.g., cold, flu, other). Your precautions will help reduce risk and keep everyone safer. The structure of this class is intended to provide flexibility so that you can prioritize your health and still be able to succeed.\nIf you do miss class because of illness:\n\nConsult the class resources on the course website\nCome to office hours on Zoom.\nUse Slack to carry out discussions.\n\nIf you miss an assessment due to illness, see the above section on Academic Concessions, and review the UBC policy here: http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,329,0,0\n\n\nInstructor health\nIf I am ill, then I will not come to class. If that happens, here’s what you can expect:\n\nIf I am well enough to teach, I will conduct virtual lectures through Zoom until I am well. If this happens, you will be tagged in an announcement via Slack with information. You can anticipate that this would very likely be a last minute announcement. Our classroom will still be available for you to sit and attend an online session, although it is recommended that you bring headphones.\nIf I am not well enough to teach, it is possible that one or more teaching assistants will take my place. But if not, we will either try to make up for lost time, make new resources to aid in your learning, or make accommodations regarding the assessments.\n\n\n\n\nCopyright\nCourse materials are licensed under Creative Commons 4.0."

Whether you’re a student enrolled in STAT 545 or simply someone looking to learn how to write reproducible and collaborative data analyses, it is our hope that this website will serve as a great resource for learning these new skills!\nIn short, this course will enable you to confidently write clean and modern data analyses in R using version control software (GitHub), and creating reports using R Markdown. The primary focus will be on using these technologies to conduct analyses with daily workflow, rather than the statistical theory and methods for analysis.\nThis course is divided into two parts. In Part I (STAT545 A), we will introduce\n\nR and RStudio,\nReport generation with R Markdown,\nProject organization, workflow, and coding style,\nData management with dataframes and tibbles using tidyverse,\nData visualization with ggplot2, and\nVersion control using Git and Github.\n\nIn Part II (STAT545 B), we will dive deeper into\n\nWriting functions in R,\nAdvanced computations on data,\nFunctional programming with purrr,\nR packages,\nInteractive pages, apps, and graphics with RShiny, and\nWebsite development using Quarto.\n\nIf you are a student enrolling in this course for credit at UBC, you MUST take STAT 545 A to enroll in STAT545 B. There are no exceptions to this rule."

    "text": "When is the course offered?\nSeptember - December of each academic year. Typical format: STAT 545A 1.5 credits in September through mid October, followed by STAT 545B 1.5 credits from mid October through early December.\n\n\nWhat happened to STAT 547M?\nSTAT 547M became STAT 545B in 2020, so that the course codes align. Otherwise, these are the same courses.\n\n\nWhat happened to the guidebook?\nWe used a guidebook in 2019/2020. It’s still available at https://stat545guidebook.netlify.app, but had become deprecated in place of worksheets and some tutorials.\n\n\nWhy are there two courses, instead of a single “STAT 545” course?\nFor several years, Jenny Bryan taught STAT 545A as a 1.5 credit course. She – and many students – felt there was a lot of great, relevant content that could go into an additional 1.5 credits.\nA full semester of data exploration, visualization, and all-around data wrangling was piloted in 2014/2015. It was structured as two half courses primarily so that several year’s worth of STAT 545A alums could register for the second part (then STAT 547M) and get the “missing half” of the course. And now it’s hard to break the cycle.\n\n\nI have taken STAT 545A for 1.5 credits in the past. Can I take STAT 545B?\nYes, but STAT 545 keeps evolving to keep current with the R world. It is your responsibility to fill in any gaps.\n\n\nCan I just take the second half, i.e. STAT 545B?\nNo, not unless you have taken STAT 545A previously.\n\n\nI am an undergraduate. Can I take this course?\nMaybe, if there’s room. Contact the instructor.\n\n\nWhat if I’ve never had a stats class?\nThere are no official pre-requisites for STAT 545A but most students will have had at least one prior statistics course or comparable experience.\n\n\nI’m not enrolled – can I sit in during class?\nA: Unfortunately not. The room is usually at capacity, and further, we’ve allocated TA time for the specific number of students attending the class. Feel free to follow along online using the online lecture resources.\n\n\nI’d like to officially audit – can I?\nAbsolutely! Please take a look at what is required of auditors in the Syllabus so that you have an understanding of your expectations coming into the course; then, fill out the form (graduate version) and send it to the instructor to get signed.\n\n\nThe course is full – can I audit instead?\nYou’ll still have to join the waitlist – auditing still counts as a seat in the class, so auditing is not a way around the course capacity.\nIn all cases, I encourage you to register! Or if the course is full, join the waitlist. Alternatively, you can engage in your own self-study using our online resources.\n\n\nThe course is full. Is there a chance that the course capacity will increase?\nUnfortunately, the course enrollment capacity will not increase. But, I encourage you to join the waitlist.\n\n\nThe course is listed as “restricted”. What should I do?\nWhen all the open seats are taken, the course is listed as “restricted”, as the remaining seats can only be taken by students of specific types. If you are a student of that type, then go ahead and register through SSC! Otherwise, I encourage you to join the waitlist.\n\n\nShould I take this course?\nThis course is open to any graduate student at UBC. Students from other departments vastly outnumber those from Statistics. In fact, the most successful students are often grad students from other fields who need to analyze and visualize data for a thesis. They are highly motivated and excel.\nHowever, if you have never programmed or worked at the command line before, prepare for a shock. This will be a powerful, positive experience, but it’s a big adjustment. Come suffer through the worst part of the learning curve in good company!\n\n\nDo I need a computer?\nYes! You absolutely must have access to a computer on which you can install software, download data, etc. In fact, class meetings will be a mix of lecture, discussion, and live coding. Students will get the most out of this if they can bring their own laptop to class every day. If this is not possible, we will try to help you work something out."

For example, if you complete the worksheet with no errors, you will get 100%. If you successfully complete 13/15 questions, your score will be 13/15 for that worksheet.\n\n\nIn class iClicker\n5%\nThree iClicker questions will be given on Tuesday’s lectures. Correctly answer at least one question to receive full marks for that lecture.\n\n\nMini Data Analysis\n45%\nStudents write their own mini analysis\n\n\nCollaborative Project\n35%\nTeam project intended for practicing version control and collaboration\n\n\n\nRegrade requests must be sent to the TAs through Slack within one week of the assessment being returned. If required, regrade requests can be escalated to the instructor only if the request has already been brought up to the TA team and the student is unsatisfied. The instructor reserves the right to regrade the entire assessment, resulting in a higher or lower mark than originally provided.\n\n\nAuditing Students\nAuditing students are expected to complete all assessments (see above). All assessments are graded on a pass/fail basis for those officially auditing.\nYou must be registered as an auditing student to attend lectures due to capacity limitations.\n\n\nCourse Communications\nWe will be using Slack as our primary platform of all course-related communications! Students will be emailed an invite to their class’ Slack workspace.\nOfficial course communications will occur on the #announcements channel. You will receive an invite on the first day of classes. Please notify the instructor by email if you have not received your personal invite.\nOur STAT 545 team will be actively monitoring Slack during regular working hours (9am to 5pm PT, Monday to Friday). You are free to ask questions outside of this window but please keep in mind that there are no expectations for the team to answer questions outside of working hours or on weekends or holidays.\nTo make the most out of Slack, please\n\nUse the #general channel for clarifications, asking about course organization, or clarifying instructions. Things you post on the #general channel will be seen by everyone, so please do not provide information that gives away answers to assignments.\nMake a group chat with our TAs when you need more personalized help, or have an issue with grading. They may direct you to the #general channel when appropriate, or direct you to the instructor.\nDirect message the instructor if there is a concern that is more personal (i.e., you need to self declare an absense) or if you have already talked to the TAs about an issue and are unsatisfied. You can also direct message the instructor if you are having issues with a group member in any group-related assignments.\nPost in the #random channel if you find things related to the course that you’d like to share\n\n\n\nPrivacy\nSlack and GitHub are hosted on servers stored outside of Canada. Please keep this in mind.\n\n\nPolicies\n\nLate Policies\nWorksheets (and larger assignments, if applicable) are due at 11:59pm PT on the date indicated in the course schedule. For a late submission, a 24 hour extension will be provided for the first offense. Late submissions will be given a grade of 0 for subsequent occurrences.\nThere is a zero-tolerance policy for late projects, including the mini data analysis and the collaborative project. If you are having issues with a team member regarding any group work, reach out to the instructor directly through Slack or email.\n\n\nAcademic Concession\nUBC no longer requires a doctor’s note (or supporting documentation) for academic concession. A self-declaration will suffice – here is a template you can use. The form is also posted on our Canvas page. Please submit this to the instructor via email.\nExamples of “conflicting responsibility” are conference travel and time-sensitive field work.\nIf you arrange to have an assignment submitted late, you may not be able to receive feedback from your peers.\n\n\nPlagiarism\nPlagiarism, which is intellectual theft, occurs where an individual submits or presents the oral or written work of another person as his or her own and can include:\n\nmultiple students submitting the same response\ncopying from sources without citing them\ncopying verbatim (word-for-word) from source and citing, but failing to make it explicit that this is a quotation (quotations should be used only rarely, if at all)\n\nStudents are responsible for ensuring that any work submitted does not constitute plagiarism. Students who are in any doubt as to what constitutes plagiarism should consult their instructor before handing in any assignments.\nFor more information see the UBC Academic Misconduct policies.\n\n\nCode Plagiarism\nStudents must correctly cite any code that has been authored by someone else or by the student themselves for other assignments. Cases of code plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:\n\nthe reproduction (copying and pasting) of code with none or minimal reformatting (e.g., changing the name of the variables)\nthe translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to another\nthe generation of code by automatic code-generations software\n\nAn “adequate acknowledgement” requires a detailed identification of the (parts of the) code reused and a full citation of the original source code that has been reused.\n\n\nUBC’s Policies and Resources to Support Student Success\nUBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious, spiritual and cultural observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions. Details of the policies and how to access support are available here.\n\n\nYour personal health\nIf you’re sick, it’s important that you stay home – no matter what you think you may be sick with (e.g., cold, flu, other). Your precautions will help reduce risk and keep everyone safer.

    "text": "Coding in R\n\nThe Basics\nLet’s get started! By this point, I’m assuming you’ve successfully installed R, RStudio, Github, and Jupyter notebooks. If you haven’t, check out the previous lecture for a guide to setting up this software.\n\n\nWhat to do when you are stuck\nWorking with technology can be hard. Coding can be especially hard. Getting stuck is very common in both cases.\nVery useful general skills for getting unstuck are to 1. learn to help yourself, and 2. learn how to productively ask for help. The content below gives self-help advice for acquiring this skill.\n\nGoogle is your friend.\n\nE.g. copy the error message, maybe strip out anything highly specific, such the name of your R objects, surround with quotes and Google it!\n\nWhile you are getting started, I recommend you seek help within the STAT545 community first (try Slack!), before, e.g. posting to external forums. We are more cuddly.\nThis stackoverflow thread How to make a great R reproducible example? is fantastic. I find that, in the process of preparing my great reproducible example, I answer my own question 90% of the time. YMMV. So it is a useful exercise even if you aren’t ready to call in the experts yet. The process of stripping your problem down to its bare essence often reveals where the root issue lies. Highly recommended!\nSearch stackoverflow and include the [r] tag. Or the [ggplot2] tag. Or the [plyr] tag. You get the idea.\nCheck out The R Inferno (see the 9th circle: “Unhelpfully seeking help”).\n\n\nIf someone has the wit and knowledge to answer your question, they probably have other things they would like to do. Making your message clear, concise and user-friendly gives you the best hope of at least one of those strangers diverting their attention away from their life towards your problem.\n\n\nRead How To Ask Questions The Smart Way by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen. You’ll need a slightly thick skin, but they speak truth.\n\n\n… demonstrate the kind of attitude that leads to competence: alert, thoughtful, observant, willing to be an active partner in developing a solution\n\n\nRead the R-help posting guide. But don’t rush to post any questions there!\nMore links via How to Ask Questions from a web-scraping class\n\nHow to Ask for Programming Help\nStack Exchange’s ‘How to ask’\nMatt Gemmell’s ‘What have you tried?’",
